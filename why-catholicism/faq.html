        <div class="qa">
          <h3>What the Church teaches</h3>
          <p>Divine Revelation is transmitted through Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition, interpreted authentically by the Magisterium (<em>Dei Verbum</em> 9–10).</p>
          <h3>Scriptural & historical basis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Acts 15 shows the apostles and elders judging a doctrinal dispute.</li>
            <li>2 Thess 2:15 exhorts believers to stand firm and hold to traditions, whether by word of mouth or letter.</li>
            <li>Early Fathers (Irenaeus) appeal to apostolic succession to preserve true teaching.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Pastoral note</h3>
          <p>Scripture remains central; Tradition safeguards its right interpretation within the living Church.</p>

      <details>
        <summary id="q2">Biblical basis for the papacy and primacy</summary>
        <div class="qa">
          <h3>What the Church teaches</h3>
          <p>Peter receives a unique pastoral office serving unity; the Bishop of Rome, as Peter’s successor, exercises a primacy of love and jurisdiction.</p>
          <h3>Scriptural & historical basis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Mt 16:18–19: “You are Peter… I will give you the keys…”</li>
            <li>Jn 21:15–17: “Feed my sheep.”</li>
            <li>Acts 1–15: Peter’s distinctive role in teaching and governance.</li>
            <li>Fathers (Irenaeus) regard the Roman Church as a normative reference.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Pastoral note</h3>
          <p>Papal primacy serves unity and truth, not domination; it is exercised collegially with the bishops.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="q3">
      <details>
        <summary id="q3">Are Catholic doctrines later inventions?</summary>
        <div class="qa">
          <h3>What the Church teaches</h3>
          <p>Doctrine develops organically—clarifying what is implicit in the apostolic deposit—without contradicting earlier teaching (cf. Newman’s development of doctrine).</p>
          <h3>Scriptural & historical basis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Councils articulate doctrine in response to new questions (e.g., Trinity, Christology).</li>
            <li>Continuity is measured by identity of faith, worship, and governance.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Pastoral note</h3>
          <p>Development helps the Church speak clearly to each age while remaining faithful to Christ’s teaching.</p>

      <details>
        <summary id="q4">Veneration of Mary and the saints vs. worship</summary>
        <div class="qa">
          <h3>What the Church teaches</h3>
          <p>Worship (latria) belongs to God alone; veneration (dulia) honors saints; Mary receives special veneration (hyperdulia) because of her unique relation to Christ.</p>
          <h3>Scriptural & historical basis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Lk 1:48: “All generations will call me blessed.”</li>
            <li>Ancient Christian practice of asking for the prayers of martyrs and saints.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Pastoral note</h3>
          <p>Rightly understood, Marian and saintly devotion directs us to Jesus and imitates their faith.</p>

      <details>
        <summary id="q5">Eucharist: symbolic or Real Presence?</summary>
        <div class="qa">
          <h3>What the Church teaches</h3>
          <p>Christ is truly, really, substantially present under the appearances of bread and wine; the Mass makes present His one sacrifice.</p>
          <h3>Scriptural & historical basis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Jn 6; 1 Cor 10:16; Last Supper narratives.</li>
            <li>Ignatius and Justin testify to early belief in the Real Presence.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Pastoral note</h3>
          <p>The Eucharist is the source and summit of Christian life, inviting deeper communion and charity.</p>

        <div class="qa">
          <h3>What the Church teaches</h3>
          <p>We are justified by grace through faith; this faith is living and expresses itself in love and obedience (Gal 5:6).</p>
          <h3>Scriptural & historical basis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Rom 3–5; James 2; Council of Trent’s Decree on Justification.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Pastoral note</h3>
          <p>Salvation is a gift; our cooperation is itself empowered by grace.</p>

        <summary id="q7">Why Catholic and not Orthodox or Protestant?</summary>
        <div class="qa">
          <h3>What the Church teaches</h3>
          <p>The Catholic Church possesses the fullness of the means of salvation and a visible universal unity centered on the successor of Peter.</p>
          <h3>Scriptural & historical basis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Visible unity and communion across time and place; apostolic succession linked to Rome from early centuries.</li>
            <li>Shared sacraments and much doctrine with Orthodox; significant real, though imperfect, communion with many Protestants.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Pastoral note</h3>
          <p>We honor the gifts present in other communities and pray for full visible unity in truth and charity.</p>
