        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>University of Arkansas at Little Rock</strong> (UA Little Rock) is a public
          research university in Little Rock, Arkansas. Established as Little Rock
          Junior College by the Little Rock School District in 1927, the institution
          became a private four‑year university under the name <em>Little Rock University</em>
          in 1957. It returned to public status in 1969 when it merged with the University
          of Arkansas System under its present name.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 250 acres (100 ha), the UA Little Rock campus encompasses more than 56
          buildings, including the Center for Nanotechnology Integrative Sciences, the
          Emerging Analytics Center, the Sequoyah Research Center, and the Ottenheimer
          Library. Additionally, UA Little Rock houses special learning facilities
          that include a learning resource center, art galleries, KUAR public radio
          station, University Television, and a campus‑wide wireless network. It is
          classified among <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Classifications" >R2: Doctoral
          Universities – High research activity</q>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The former campus of Little Rock Junior College is now (2019) the campus of
          Philander Smith University. Students benefit from the proximity of the
          campus to downtown Little Rock, enabling access to a wide array of
          recreational, entertainment, educational, internship and employment
          opportunities that are <strong>not available anywhere else in Arkansas</strong>.
        </p>

          UA Little Rock offers more than 100 undergraduate degrees and 60 graduate
          degrees, including graduate certificates, master's degrees, and doctorates,
          through both traditional and online courses. Students attend classes in
          one of the university's three colleges and its law school:
